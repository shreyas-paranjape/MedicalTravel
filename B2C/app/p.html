  <p> Implants : Dental implants are frequently the best option for replacing missing teeth. Rather than removable dentures, or fixed bridges, dental implants are the long-term replacements of choice. The implant is an artificial root usually made of titanium that your implant specialist surgically places in the jawbone.
- Dentures : A denture is a removable replacement for missing teeth and surrounding tissues. Two types of dentures are available: complete and partial. Complete dentures are used when all the teeth are missing, while partial dentures are used when some natural teeth remain.
- Crowns and Bridges : A crown is a type of dental restoration that, when cemented into place, fully cups over that portion of a tooth that lies at and above the gum line. Since it encases the entire visible aspect of a tooth, a dental crown, in effect, becomes the tooth's new outer
    Hip replacement :Hip replacement surgery is a procedure in which a doctor surgically removes a painful hip joint and replaces it with an artificial joint often made from metal and plastic components. It usually is done when all other treatment options have failed to provide adequate pain relief.
 - Hip resurfacing
 - Total Knee replacement :Knee replacement surgery can be performed as a partial or a total knee replacement.[2] In general, the surgery consists of replacing the diseased or damaged joint surfaces of the knee with metal and plastic components shaped to allow continued motion of the knee.
    Gastric Bypass :Gastric bypass surgery makes the stomach smaller and causes food to bypass part of the small intestine. You will feel full more quickly than when your stomach was its original size. This reduces the amount of food you can eat at one time. Bypassing part of the intestine reduces how much food and nutrients are absorbed. This leads to weight loss.
- Gastric Banding : The surgeon uses laparoscopy (which involves small cuts in the belly) to place an adjustable silicone band around the upper part of the stomach. Squeezed by the silicone band, the stomach becomes a pouch with about an inch-wide outlet. After banding, the stomach can hold only about an ounce of food.A plastic tube runs from the silicone band to a device just under the skin. Saline (sterile salt water) can be injected or removed through the skin, flowing into or out of the silicone band. Injecting saline fills the band and makes it tighter. In this way, the band can be tightened or loosened as needed to reduce side effects and improve weight loss.
