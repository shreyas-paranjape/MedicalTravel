Popular procedures

Bariatrics
- Gastric Bypass :Gastric bypass surgery makes the stomach smaller and causes food to bypass part of the small intestine. You will feel full more quickly than when your stomach was its original size. This reduces the amount of food you can eat at one time. Bypassing part of the intestine reduces how much food and nutrients are absorbed. This leads to weight loss.
- Gastric Banding : The surgeon uses laparoscopy (which involves small cuts in the belly) to place an adjustable silicone band around the upper part of the stomach. Squeezed by the silicone band, the stomach becomes a pouch with about an inch-wide outlet. After banding, the stomach can hold only about an ounce of food.A plastic tube runs from the silicone band to a device just under the skin. Saline (sterile salt water) can be injected or removed through the skin, flowing into or out of the silicone band. Injecting saline fills the band and makes it tighter. In this way, the band can be tightened or loosened as needed to reduce side effects and improve weight loss.

Orthopedics
 - Hip replacement :Hip replacement surgery is a procedure in which a doctor surgically removes a painful hip joint and replaces it with an artificial joint often made from metal and plastic components. It usually is done when all other treatment options have failed to provide adequate pain relief.
 - Hip resurfacing
 - Total Knee replacement :Knee replacement surgery can be performed as a partial or a total knee replacement.[2] In general, the surgery consists of replacing the diseased or damaged joint surfaces of the knee with metal and plastic components shaped to allow continued motion of the knee.
  - Arthroscopy :Arthroscopy (also called arthroscopic surgery) is a minimally invasive surgical procedure on a joint in which an examination and sometimes treatment of damage is performed using an arthroscope, an endoscope that is inserted into the joint through a small incision.
 - ACL reconstruction :ACL reconstruction is surgery to rebuild the ligament in the center of your knee. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) keeps your shin bone (tibia) in place. A tear of this ligament can cause your knee to give way during physical activity.

Cosmetics
 - Rhytidectomy (facelift) : The procedure is a type of cosmetic surgery procedure used to give a more youthful appearance. It usually involves the removal of excess facial skin with or without the tightening of underlying tissues, and the redraping of the skin on the patients face and neck.
 - Breast augmentation : Breast augmentation surgery, also known as augmentation mammaplasty, is the surgical placement of breast implants to increase fullness and improve symmetry of the breasts, or to restore breast volume lost after weight reduction or pregnancy.
 - Breast Reduction : Breast reduction is a plastic surgery procedure that lifts the breast and makes it smaller.
 - Abdominoplasty : Abdominoplasty or "tummy tuck" is a cosmetic surgery procedure used to make the abdomen thinner and more firm. The surgery involves the removal of excess skin and fat from the middle and lower abdomen in order to tighten the muscle and fascia of the abdominal wall.
 - Buttock lift : This procedure is carried out to improve the contour of the buttocks. This is done either by removing access skin and tightening the skin above the upper part of the buttocks or a lift by fat injections or silicon
 - Rhinoplasty : Rhinoplsty is reshaping of nose. The reshaping can be done to improve the appearance of an otherwise normal nose, or to reconstruct a damaged nose.

Cardiovascular
- CABG (bypass) :Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a type of surgery that improves blood flow to the heart. Surgeons use CABG to treat people who have severe coronary heart disease (CHD). CHD is a disease in which a waxy substance called plaque (plak) builds up inside the coronary arteries
- Cogential surgeries : Congenital heart defect corrective surgery fixes or treats a heart defect that a child is born with. A baby born with one or more heart defects has congenital heart disease. Surgery is needed if the defect is dangerous to the child’s health or well-being.
- Valve surgeries (repair/ replacement) : In most cases, heart valve replacement is an open heart operation. This means that the surgeon opens your chest and heart to remove the damaged valve. The new artificial (prosthetic) valve is then sewn into place. In some cases, the valve can be replaced without opening the chest.

Dental
- Implants : Dental implants are frequently the best option for replacing missing teeth. Rather than removable dentures, or fixed bridges, dental implants are the long-term replacements of choice. The implant is an artificial root usually made of titanium that your implant specialist surgically places in the jawbone.
- Dentures : A denture is a removable replacement for missing teeth and surrounding tissues. Two types of dentures are available: complete and partial. Complete dentures are used when all the teeth are missing, while partial dentures are used when some natural teeth remain.
- Crowns and Bridges : A crown is a type of dental restoration that, when cemented into place, fully cups over that portion of a tooth that lies at and above the gum line. Since it encases the entire visible aspect of a tooth, a dental crown, in effect, becomes the tooth's new outer surface. In comparison, dental fillings are restorations that fill in or patch just a portion of a tooth. Other terms that are used to refer to crowns are "dental caps" and "tooth caps".
A bridge is made the same way as a crown — in fact a bridge is several crowns attached together. A bridge may be recommended if you're missing one or more teeth. Gaps left by missing teeth eventually cause the remaining teeth to rotate or shift into the empty spaces, resulting in a bad bite. The imbalance caused by missing teeth can also lead to gum disease and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders.
- Impacted teeth Surgery - An impacted tooth is a common dental condition occurring when a tooth fails to fully emerge from the gums. Most teeth break through the gums, but sometimes misalignment or injury prevents proper growth out of the gums or bones. If these teeth partially emerge they may trap food or bacteria in the soft tissue around them, which causes the gums and surrounding tissue to rot. The most common teeth to become impacted are the third molars or "wisdom teeth” since they erupt so late in life and because most people's jaws are not large enough to accommodate them.
-Veneers - Dental veneers are attached to the front of teeth, either to improve the aesthetics of a tooth or to protect the tooth's surface from damage. They can be made with direct composite, applied directly to teeth and then shaped by a cosmetic dentist, or with indirect composite or porcelain.
- Maxillofacial surgery - Oral & Maxillofacial surgery (OMS) specializes in treating many diseases, injuries and defects in the head, neck, face, jaws and the hard and soft tissues of the Oral (mouth) and Maxillofacial (jaws and face) region. It is an internationally recognized surgical specialty.

Opthalmology 
-Corneal transplant : Corneal transplantation, also known as corneal grafting or penetrating keratoplasty, is a surgical procedure where a damaged or diseased cornea is replaced by donated corneal tissue.
-Cataract Surgery : Clouded lens of the eye is surgically removed and replaced with a plastic or siliccone intraocular lens inside the eye. the lens may be placed between the iris and the cornea or just behind the cornea.

OBGYN
- Hysterectomy :  Hysterectomy is the surgical removal of the uterus. It may also involve removal of the cervix, ovaries, fallopian tubes and other surrounding structures.
- Myomectomy : Myomectomy is the surgical removal of fibroids from the uterus. It allows the uterus to be left in place and, for some women, makes pregnancy more likely than before. Myomectomy is the preferred fibroid treatment for women who want to become pregnant.

IVF and reproductive sciences
- Intra Uterine Insemination (IUI):One of the first line treatments, especially for Male factor infertility, Unexplained infertility & in combination with Ovulation induction.
- In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) :Also called “Test Tube Babies”, useful in severe Male infertility, Older couples, Damaged fallopian tubes, Endometriosis or Failed attempts at IUI.
- Intra Cytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI):For Severe male infertility, Surgically obtained sperm, and Previously failed attempts at IVF, it involves direct injection of an egg with a sperm.
- Blastocyst Culture : Culture of fertilized ovum for up to five days which allows selection of best growing embryos resulting in a higher pregnancy rate and lowered risk of multiple pregnancy.
- Assisted Hatching : Weakening of the Zona (shell surrounding the fertilized ovum) in order to improve implantation rates in select cases like older women, thick zona, repeated implantation failures etc.
- Donor Insemination :In cases where the Husband’s semen has no sperms or some genetic abnormality etc., sperms from anonymous donors can be used to achieve pregnancy.
- Sperm, Oocyte & Embryo Freezing :Sperms, eggs or embryos obtained at one cycle of treatment may be frozen for the next cycle. This is used to reduce costs or to avoid side effects like multiple pregnancy or hyper-stimulation.
- Complete Testing & Counseling : Complete testing of couples for infertility and counseling towards treatment options, proposed management, complications etc.
- Sperm Extraction : In case of obstruction to male reproductive system, sperms can be extracted from the testes or the epididymis
- Surgery for Male Infertility : Operative correction of male infertility problems like varicocele associated with oligospermia etc.
